# MultiNotation Modeler - Path Resolution

## Issue Explanation

The errors you're seeing:

```
ERROR
unable to locate 'D:/ETSII/4 CARRERA/2C/TFG/VisualPPINOT/app/MultiNotationModeler/notations/PPINOT-modeler/PPINOT/PPINOTModdle.json' glob
ERROR
unable to locate 'D:/ETSII/4 CARRERA/2C/TFG/VisualPPINOT/app/MultiNotationModeler/notations/RALPH-modeler/RALph/RALphModdle.json' glob
```

These errors occur because the import paths in your code don't match the actual file structure of your project. 

## Current vs. Expected Paths

### Current Structure (Working)
- `app/PPINOT-modeler/PPINOT/PPINOTModdle.json`
- `app/RALPH-modeler/RALph/RALphModdle.json`

### Path Being Used (Causing Error)
- `app/MultiNotationModeler/notations/PPINOT-modeler/PPINOT/PPINOTModdle.json`
- `app/MultiNotationModeler/notations/RALPH-modeler/RALph/RALphModdle.json`

## Solution Approach

I've created several files that implement the architecture described in your document, but adapted to work with your current project structure:

1. `app/js/event-bus.js` - The Event Bus component for communication
2. `app/js/panel-registry.js` - Static panel registration
3. `app/js/boot.js` - Handles mounting all panels during initialization
4. `app/js/MultiNotationModelerCore.js` - Core integration component
5. `app/js/architecture-integration.js` - Example of how to integrate with existing code

### How to Use These Components

1. **Short-term integration (no restructuring)**:
   - Add a script tag to load `architecture-integration.js` in your HTML
   - This will add a button to test the new architecture alongside your existing code

2. **Gradual integration**:
   - Follow the steps in `migration_plan.md` for a phased approach
   - Start by integrating the Event Bus for communication
   - Then add panel registration and mounting through the boot process

3. **Full migration**:
   - Once the integration is working, you can follow the directory structure in `implementation_guide.md`
   - Move files to their new locations
   - Update import paths throughout the project

## Fixing Import Issues

If you want to keep the current implementation and fix the immediate errors:

1. Check your webpack.config.js for any path aliases or resolve settings that might be incorrect
2. Verify that the import statements in app.js match the actual file locations
3. Ensure that your development server is configured to find files in the correct locations

Current import in app.js:
```javascript
import PPINOTModdle from './PPINOT-modeler/PPINOT/PPINOTModdle.json';
import RALphModdle from './RALPH-modeler/RALph/RALphModdle.json';
```

## Testing the New Architecture

To test the new architecture components without modifying your existing code:

1. Add this to the end of your HTML file:
```html
<script type="module" src="js/architecture-integration.js"></script>
```

2. This will add a button to your interface that will initialize the new architecture components
3. Click the button and check the console for any errors

## Recommended Approach

1. First, fix the immediate path errors in your current implementation
2. Then gradually integrate the new architecture components as described in the migration plan
3. Finally, restructure your project to match the target architecture

This approach minimizes risk and allows you to verify that each component works correctly before proceeding to the next step.
